***In the ski-resort dataset, the category features are name, Region and State while the remaining features are numerical. There tends to not be a reasonable pattern between states and ticket price which is explained by the 77.2% variance. The features that are important in the subsequent modeling should include Runs, fastQuads, Snow Making_ac since the have some decent positive relationship with the ticket price. Feature like fastSixes does not really have a relationship with the ticket price. Treating all states equally will be ideal because they all have their unique importance. Even though NY is not seem to stand out when it comes to density of ski resorts, it might be a good fit in-terms of other features like counts of the number of terrain parks at the resort. Working towards building a pricing model that considers all states together without a special treat is a great idea.***
